# dotfiles
## Description
My collection of bash and vim dotfiles and their install scripts collected from github with a few tweaks of my own. Also includes a script to install vim and Vundle.

## Usage
The dotfiles can be installed by executing `source install.sh` or `./install.sh`. Update can be executed the same way to remove the current files that install replaces (redundant). setupLinux.sh installs vim and Vundle.

### install.sh
Invoke `install.sh -a` to install all dotfiles, or list them individually by name to install a subset of them
